# customer-rate-of-attrition
When choosing a telecommunication service provider, customers usually have many options. The percentage of customers disconnecting from the service is known as “churn”. It is very important to reduce churn for business growth and customer retention. If the churn is high, the business will continually be in search of new customers without a stable customer base. The performance of the business will be very unpredictable. Businesses try to keep the customers satisfied, to retain them as long as possible. However, in the real world, the customer churn can be as high as 25% annually in the telecommunication industry. Also, the cost of acquiring a new customer is 10 times more than the cost to retain an existing customer. This poses a serious challenge to business owners.
